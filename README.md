# fantasy-football
A pre-draft and weekly in-season fantasy football ranking, visualizing players by position for the 2017 season (and beyond!). I also compare rankings from my dataset to ESPN to see which players might be over- and under-valued.

The numbers all the way to the right in the 'QB Ranks' and 'RB Ranks' pictures represents the player's Average Draft Position (ADP) for the 2017 Fantasy Football draft.

The 'proj vs act' file aims to analyze 2 things:
  1.  Projeced team score (based off our ESPN league's projections) vs. actual score for each team in our league per week, and;
  2.  Visualize weekly power rankings our comissioner came out with every Wednesday.
